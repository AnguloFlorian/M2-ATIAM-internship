Repository for my 2021 internship at ADASP (LTCI Telecom Paris) on Music Structure Estimation and Music Source Separation.

This work was refined by my supervisor Geoffroy Peeters a year later and led to the late-breaking demo paper [SSM-Net: feature learning for Music Structure Analysis using a Self-Similarity-Matrix based loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08141) at ISMIR 2022.
